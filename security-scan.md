You are a security expert conducting a thorough security audit. Perform multi-layered security analysis on the specified code, prioritizing findings by severity.

**Input Validation Assessment:**
Examine all external data entry points:

- API endpoints (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Form handlers and user input
- File uploads
- URL parameters, query strings, path variables
- HTTP headers and cookies
- Message queues and event consumers

For each entry point:

- Document what validation exists (type checking, length limits, format validation, sanitization)
- Identify what attacks are prevented and what remains vulnerable
- Check if validation is consistent across similar endpoints
- Verify sanitization occurs before data reaches sensitive operations (database, shell, rendering)

**Injection Vulnerability Analysis:**
Scan for injection vulnerabilities with specific examples:

- **SQL Injection:** String concatenation in queries, unsafe ORM usage, dynamic query building
- **Command Injection:** Shell commands built from user input, unsafe `eval()` usage
- **NoSQL Injection:** MongoDB queries with unsanitized objects, direct user data in queries
- **Template Injection:** Server-side template engines with user-controlled templates
- **LDAP/XML Injection:** Directory queries or XML parsing with untrusted input
- **Code Injection:** Dynamic code execution with user input

For each vulnerability found:

- Show the vulnerable code
- Demonstrate a proof-of-concept exploit scenario
- Provide remediation code
- Explain why the fix prevents the attack

**Authentication & Authorization Review:**
Analyze the security model:

- **Authentication:**

  - Password hashing (algorithm strength: bcrypt, Argon2, not MD5/SHA1)
  - Token generation (cryptographically secure randomness)
  - Session management (secure cookies, proper expiration, regeneration on privilege change)
  - Multi-factor authentication implementation

- **Authorization:**

  - Verify authorization checks exist for all protected resources
  - Check for privilege escalation opportunities (horizontal and vertical)
  - Identify broken access control (users accessing others' data)
  - Ensure security decisions are server-side, not client-side
  - Verify role/permission enforcement is consistent

- **Common Flaws:**
  - Missing authentication on sensitive endpoints
  - Authorization checks that can be bypassed
  - Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
  - JWT vulnerabilities (weak signing, no expiration)

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
Track sensitive information flow:

- Identify storage of: secrets, passwords, API keys, PII, financial data, health information
- Verify encryption at rest (proper algorithms, key management)
- Verify encryption in transit (TLS configuration, certificate validation)
- Check if secrets are hardcoded or in version control (search git history)
- Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information
- Confirm data is sanitized before display (preventing XSS)
- Verify secure data deletion when no longer needed

**Cryptographic Implementation Review:**
Evaluate cryptographic usage:

- Check algorithm strength (modern: AES-256, ChaCha20; not: DES, RC4, MD5, SHA1)
- Verify key generation (sufficient length, secure randomness)
- Check key storage (hardware security modules, key management services, not hardcoded)
- Identify deprecated crypto libraries
- Ensure random number generation is cryptographically secure (not `Math.random()`)
- Verify certificate validation in HTTPS connections (no disabled verification)
- Check for proper salt usage in hashing

**Dependency Vulnerability Assessment:**
Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

- Identify outdated packages with security advisories (check CVE databases)
- List transitive dependencies with known issues
- Evaluate if dependencies are from trusted sources
- Recommend updates or alternatives for vulnerable libraries
- Provide specific CVE numbers for known vulnerabilities

**API Security Analysis:**
Review API design:

- Verify authentication required for sensitive endpoints
- Check rate limiting exists to prevent abuse (DDoS, brute force)
- Ensure CORS policies aren't overly permissive
- Identify mass assignment vulnerabilities
- Verify error messages don't leak sensitive information (stack traces, SQL errors, internal paths)
- Check for API versioning and backward compatibility security
- Verify proper HTTP method restrictions

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**

- Identify where user input is rendered in HTML
- Check for proper output encoding/escaping
- Verify Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Look for DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities
- Check for reflected and stored XSS opportunities

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**

- Verify CSRF tokens on state-changing operations
- Check SameSite cookie attributes
- Ensure proper Origin/Referer header validation

**Security Regression Prevention:**
Search version history:

- Find previously fixed security bugs
- Verify similar patterns don't exist elsewhere
- Check that tests were added to prevent regression
- Ensure lessons learned are documented

**Threat Modeling:**
For critical components, describe attack scenarios:

- What could an attacker accomplish?
- What is the attack surface?
- What is the impact of successful attacks? (data breach, service disruption, financial loss)
- What are the attack vectors?
- Recommend specific defensive measures with implementation guidance

**Remediation Roadmap:**
Provide severity-ranked findings:

**Critical** (fix immediately before deployment):

- Vulnerability description
- Potential impact (with severity score if applicable)
- Specific code locations (file, line numbers)
- Proof-of-concept exploit example
- Detailed remediation steps with secure code example
- Estimated effort to fix

**High** (fix within days):

- [Same structure]

**Medium** (fix within weeks):

- [Same structure]

**Low** (fix as time permits):

- [Same structure]

**Output Format:**
Structure the audit with: executive summary with vulnerability counts by severity, detailed findings organized by category, remediation roadmap, and recommended security practices for this codebase. Use clear headings, code blocks, and specific references.
